                    <div class="textimg-text">
                        <p> Our journey began with an analysis of Sweden's ambulance healthcare system, with a specific focus on the Halland region. Despite initial hurdles in accessing online resources, our research team conducted interviews with nurses and stakeholders and engaged in on-the-ground observations to gain insights into the complex dynamics of pre-hospital care. These efforts provided a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by nurses and the systemic issues affecting information dissemination within the organization.</p>

                        <p> <b>Comprehensive Understanding: </b>Interviews with nurses revealed a reliance on a combination of physical and digital resources for pre-hospital care support. Nurses expressed a preference for digital documentation, particularly for medication updates, highlighting the need for a more streamlined and accessible information system.</p>
                        <p> <b>Refinement of Scope: </b>Observations within ambulance healthcare settings provided crucial context and domain knowledge, serving as a foundation for identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement. It became evident that while the organization had already acquired an application for fieldwork support, there were perceived shortcomings based on feedback from other regions. This prompted a strategic pivot, refocusing our efforts on developing an application specifically designed to address the pressing need for efficient dissemination of critical updates and guidelines.                    </p>

                <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
                <div class="textimg-column">
                    <div class="textimg-text">
                        <p><b>Thorough Research and Observation are Critical: </b>The initial focus on comprehensive research, including interviews with nurses and on-the-ground observations, provided valuable insights into the complexities of Sweden's ambulance healthcare system. The lesson here is that direct interaction with stakeholders and field observations can reveal key pain points and contextual understanding, which are critical for defining the problem and guiding the design process.</p>
                        <p><b>Collaborative Sketching and Prototyping Enhance Creativity: </b>Collaborative sketching sessions and prototyping using Figma allowed the team to brainstorm, visualize, and refine the application's key functions. This collaborative approach fostered creativity and ensured that design elements aligned with user needs. The learning point is that collaborative ideation can lead to more innovative and user-friendly designs.</p>
                        <p><b>Finding solutions in uncertainty: </b>When our team began this project, we felt uncertain about how to address the problem in the brief. It quickly became clear that the issue was more complex than we initially thought. To navigate this, we took a step back and re-evaluated our approach, which helped us identify the real issues and adjust our focus. We realized that sometimes the brief doesn't capture the whole problem, and it's important to consider the broader context. The key lesson for our team was that embracing uncertainty and staying flexible are crucial for innovation. By questioning our initial approach and exploring different angles, we found solutions that addressed deeper issues and led to better outcomes. From my perspective, this experience taught me the value of adaptability and critical thinking. I learned that it's crucial to question assumptions and that collaboration helps find the best solutions. This project boosted my confidence in handling ambiguity and taught me to approach problems with an open mind.</p>
